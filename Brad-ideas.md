#Brad's Idea list

- I had these ideas awhile ago, so I'm not sure how relevant they are, but alas, I figure they are better put here than nowhere.

- An RPG 8-bit. I don’t like the idea of it being strictly side scrolling though... i was thinking about the idea that it could be an open source game. Story game for sure. But a story that other people would be able to add to. Like other people would be able to develop their own chapters to the game. It’s strength would come from the deep storytelling. Like a cult following. And then people could post their own chapters online. Maybe we would have certified authors to the official storyline. I was thinking of making the game many faceted too. Like characters in the game send you emails, or have their own websites, or are “alive” in some way. And the game has to be across multiple vehicles of storytelling. In books, games, blogs, YouTube channel, etc. My idea is to create a culture and following with a game like this. It wouldn’t be strictly a videogame, rather, a multifaceted way of storytelling. I just find videogames as a very immersive way to tell a story. You would follow a hero over many adventures. Male or female? Eh, not sure. Also, I love customization and progression. So how would we work that in? Also, I like the idea of belonging to a certain faction. Like Pokémon go, how you choose your loyalty.
